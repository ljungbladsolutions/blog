How often do open Chrome and search for something to find an already known site. Usually we do add a bookmark in Chrome  
to make it easy to revisit frequently visited pages. 

Improve productivity by using chrome bookmarks

### Structure bookmarks

### Use aliases

1. Go to chrome://settings/searchEngines
2. Find the `Add` button
3. Enter `Search engine` which is just a description of that `url`, then the `keywork` (the alias), and then the `url`.
4. There is also a feature where it's possible to add `in parameters` for the url.  
For example: `http://supermaps?search=%s` Then if the `keyword`is `map`, you would use `map stockholm` to get `http://supermaps?search=stockholm  `

#### Quickly add a new alias
Add the `chrome://settings/searchEngines` url as a keyword. 
*For example:* 
- Search engine: Add a new alias as a searchEngine
- Keword: newalias
- Query url: chrome://settings/searchEngines  

Now the only thing you need to do is to write `newalias` in the `omnibox` (addressbar) to open Chrome SearchEngine and add a new alias to the url you just probably just copied.

There are also many extensions for having aliases.

Write something about chrome bookmarks.
